Handling Precautions
Camera Care
This camera is a precision instrument. Do not drop it or subject it to physical
shock.
The camera is not waterproof and cannot be used underwater. If you
accidentally drop the camera into water, promptly consult your nearest
Canon Service Center. Wipe off any water droplets with a dry cloth. If the
camera has been exposed to salty air, wipe it with a well-wrung wet cloth.
Never leave the camera near anything having a strong magnetic field such
as a magnet or electric motor. Also avoid using or leaving the camera near
anything emitting strong radio waves such as a large antenna. Strong
magnetic fields can cause camera misoperation or destroy image data.
Do not leave the camera in excessive heat such as in a car in direct sunlight.
High temperatures can cause the camera to malfunction.
The camera contains precision electronic circuitry. Never attempt to
disassemble the camera yourself.
Use a blower to blow away dust on the lens, viewfinder, reflex mirror, and
focusing screen. Do not use cleaners that contain organic solvents to clean
the camera body or lens. For stubborn dirt, take the camera to the nearest
Canon Service Center.
Do not touch the camera’s electrical contacts with your fingers. This is to
prevent the contacts from corroding. Corroded contacts can cause camera
misoperation.
If the camera is suddenly brought in from the cold into a warm room,
condensation may form on the camera and internal parts. To prevent
condensation, first put the camera in a sealed plastic bag and let it adjust to
the warmer temperature before taking it out of the bag.
If condensation forms on the camera, do not use the camera. This is to avoid
damaging the camera. If there is condensation, remove the lens, card and
battery from the camera, and wait until the condensation has evaporated
before using the camera.
If the camera will not be used for an extended period, remove the battery
and store the camera in a cool, dry, well-ventilated location. Even while the
camera is in storage, press the shutter button a few times once in a while to
check that the camera is still working.
Avoid storing the camera where there are corrosive chemicals such as a
darkroom or chemical lab.
If the camera has not been used for an extended period, test all its functions
before using it. If you have not used the camera for some time or if there is
an important shoot coming up, have the camera checked by your Canon
dealer or check the camera yourself and make sure it is working properly.

Handling Precautions

LCD Monitor
Although the LCD monitor is manufactured with very high precision
technology with over 99.99% effective pixels, there might be a few dead
pixels among the remaining 0.01% or less pixels. Dead pixels displaying
only black or red, etc., are not a malfunction. They do not affect the images
recorded.
If the LCD monitor is left on for a prolonged period, screen burn-in may occur
where you see remnants of what was displayed. However, this is only
temporary and will disappear when the camera is left unused for a few days.
In low or high temperatures, the LCD monitor display may seem slow or it
might look black. It will return to normal at room temperature.

Cards
To protect the card and its recorded data, note the following:
Do not drop, bend, or wet the card. Do not subject it to excessive force,
physical shock, or vibration.
Do not touch the card’s electronic contacts with your fingers or anything
metallic.
Do not store or use the card near anything having a strong magnetic field
such as a TV set, speakers, or magnet. Also avoid places prone to having
static electricity.
Do not leave the card in direct sunlight or near a heat source.
Store the card in a case.
Do not store the card in hot, dusty, or humid locations.

Lens

C

Y
P
O

After detaching the lens from the camera, attach the lens
caps or put down the lens with the rear end up to avoid
scratching the lens surface and electrical contacts.

Contacts

Cautions During Prolonged Use
If you use continuous shooting, Live View shooting, or
movie shooting for a prolonged period, the camera may
become hot. Although this is not a malfunction, holding the
hot camera for a long period can cause slight skin burns.

About smudges adhering to the front of the sensor
Besides dust entering the camera from outside, in rare cases lubricant from the
camera’s internal parts may adhere to the front of the sensor. If visible spots
remain on the image, having the sensor cleaned by a Canon Service Center is
recommended.

X When the battery is fully recharged,

the full-charge lamp will turn green.
It takes approx. 2 hours to fully recharge a completely exhausted
battery at 23°C / 73°F. The time required to recharge the battery
depends on the ambient temperature and the battery’s charge
level.
For safety reasons, recharging in low temperatures (6°C - 10°C /
43°F - 50°F) will take a longer time (up to 4 hours).

26

Charging the Battery

Tips for Using the Battery and Charger
Upon purchase, the battery is not fully charged.
Recharge the battery before using.
Recharge the battery on the day before or on the day it is to be
used.
Even during storage, a charged battery will gradually drain and lose
its power.
After recharging the battery, detach it and unplug the charger
from the power outlet.
When not using the camera, remove the battery.
If the battery is left in the camera for a prolonged period, a small
amount of power current is released, resulting in excess discharge
and shorter battery life. Store the battery with the protective cover
(provided) attached. Storing the battery after it is fully charged can
lower the battery’s performance.

C

Y
P
O

The battery charger can also be used in foreign countries.
The battery charger is compatible with a 100 V AC to 240 V AC 50/
60 Hz power source. If necessary, attach a commercially-available
plug adapter for the respective country or region. Do not attach any
portable voltage transformer to the battery charger. Doing so can
damage the battery charger.
If the battery becomes exhausted quickly even after being fully
charged, the battery has reached the end of its service life.
Purchase a new battery.

After disconnecting the charger’s power plug, do not touch the prongs for
at least 3 sec.
Do not charge any battery other than a Battery Pack LP-E10.
The Battery Pack LP-E10 is dedicated to Canon products only. Using it
with an incompatible battery charger or product may result in malfunction
or accidents for which Canon cannot be held liable.

27

Installing and Removing the Battery and Card
Load a fully-charged Battery Pack LP-E10 into the camera. The card
(sold separately) can be an SD, SDHC, or SDXC memory card. The
captured images are recorded onto the card.
Make sure the card’s write-protect switch is set upward to
enable writing/erasing.

Installing and Removing the Battery and Card

When the access lamp is lit or blinking, it indicates that images are
being written to or read by the card, being erased, or data is being
transferred. When the access lamp is lit or blinking, do not open the
card/battery compartment cover and never do any of the following.
Otherwise, the image data may be destroyed or the card or camera
may be damaged.
• Removing the card.
• Removing the battery.
• Shaking or banging the camera around.
If the card already contains recorded images, the image number might
not start from 0001 (p.158).
Do not touch the card’s contacts with your fingers or metal objects.
If a card-related error message is displayed on the LCD monitor, remove
and reinsert the card. If the error persists, use a different card. If you can
transfer all the images on the card to a computer, transfer all the images
and then format the card with the camera (p.44). The card may then
return to normal.

loss of vision.
If the front part (focusing ring) of the lens rotates during autofocusing, do
not touch the rotating part.

Image Conversion Factor
Since the image sensor size is
smaller than the 35mm film
format, it will look like the lens
focal length is increased by

About the Lens Image Stabilizer
When you use the IS lens’ built-in Image Stabilizer, camera shake is
corrected to obtain a sharper shot. The procedure explained here is
based on the EF-S18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS II lens as an example.

viewfinder, press the shutter button
completely to take the picture.

C

The Image Stabilizer may not be effective if the subject moves at the time
of exposure.
The Image Stabilizer may not be effective for excessive shaking such as
on a rocking boat.
The Image Stabilizer can operate with the focus mode switch set to
either <f> or <g>.
If the camera is mounted on a tripod, you can save battery power by
switching the IS switch to <2>.
The Image Stabilizer is effective even when the camera is mounted on a
monopod.
Some IS lenses enable you to switch the IS mode manually to suit the
shooting conditions. However, the EF-S18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS II switches
the IS mode automatically.

37

Basic Operation
Adjusting the Viewfinder Clarity
Turn the dioptric adjustment
knob.
Turn the knob left or right until the
nine AF points in the viewfinder look
sharp.
If the camera’s dioptric adjustment still cannot provide a sharp viewfinder
image, using Dioptric Adjustment Lens E (10 types, sold separately) is
recommended.

Holding the Camera

halfway, the LCD monitor will turn off
(p.166).

Y
P
O

Pressing completely
This releases the shutter and takes the
picture.

C

Preventing Camera Shake
Hand-held camera movement during the moment of exposure is called
camera shake. It can cause blurred pictures. To prevent camera shake,
note the following:
• Hold and steady the camera as shown on the previous page.
• Press the shutter button halfway to autofocus, then slowly press the
shutter button completely.
If you press the shutter button completely without pressing it halfway first
or if you press the shutter button halfway and then press it completely

A card-related error is displayed (p.250).
About Low-level Formatting
Do low-level formatting if the card’s recording or reading speed seems slow
or if you want to totally erase all data in the card.
Since low-level formatting will erase all recordable sectors in the card, the
formatting will take slightly longer than normal formatting.
You can stop the low-level formatting by selecting [Cancel]. Even in this
case, normal formatting will have been completed and you can use the
card as usual.

P
O

When the card is formatted or data is erased, only the file management
information is changed. The actual data is not completely erased. Be
aware of this when selling or discarding the card. When discarding the
card, execute low-level formatting or destroy the card physically to
prevent the data from being leaked.
Before using a new Eye-Fi card, the software in the card must be
installed in your computer. Then format the card with the camera.
The card capacity displayed on the card format screen might be smaller
than the capacity indicated on the card.

Although it is daylight, the flash popped up.
For a backlit subject, the flash may pop up to help lighten the
subject’s dark areas.
In low light, the built-in flash fired a series of flashes.
Pressing the shutter button halfway may trigger the built-in flash to
fire a series of flashes to assist autofocusing. This is called AF-assist
beam. Its effective range is about 4 meters/13.1 feet.
Although flash was used, the picture came out dark.
The subject was too far away. The subject should be within 5
meters/16.4 feet from the camera.
When flash was used, the bottom part of the picture came out
unnaturally dark.
The subject was too close to the camera, and a shadow was created
by the lens barrel. The subject should be at least 1 meter/3.3 feet
away from the camera. If a hood has been attached to the lens,
remove it before taking the flash picture.

1 Full Auto Techniques
Recomposing the Shot

Depending on the scene, position the subject toward the left or right to
create a balanced background and good perspective.
In the <1> (Full Auto) mode, while you press the shutter button
halfway to focus a still subject, the focus will be locked. You can then
recompose the shot and press the shutter button completely to take the
picture. This is called “focus lock”. Focus lock is also possible in other
Basic Zone modes (except <5> Sports).

O

In the <1> (Full Auto) mode, if the subject moves (distance to camera
changes) during or after you focus, AI Servo AF will take effect to focus
the subject continuously. As long as you keep aiming the AF point on
the subject while pressing the shutter button halfway, the focusing will
be continuous. When you want to take the picture, press the shutter
button completely.

Shooting Tips

C

Y
P
O

Prevent camera shake if the numeric display in the viewfinder
blinks.
Under low light when camera shake is prone to occur, the
viewfinder’s shutter speed display will blink. Hold the camera steady
or use a tripod. When using a zoom lens, use the wide-angle end to
reduce blur caused by camera shake.
Taking portraits without flash.
In low-light conditions, tell the subject to keep still until the picture is
taken. If the person moves during the exposure, he or she might look
blurred in the picture.

2 Shooting Portraits
The <2> (Portrait) mode blurs the background to make the human
subject stand out. It also makes skin tones and the hair look softer than
with the <1> (Full Auto) mode.

Shooting Tips

C

Y
P
O

The further the distance between the subject and background,
the better.
The further the distance between the subject and background, the
more blurred the background will look. The subject will also stand
out better in front of a plain, dark background.
Use a telephoto lens.
If you have a zoom lens, use the telephoto end to fill the frame with
the subject from the waist up. Move in closer if necessary.
Focus the face.
Check that the AF point covering the face flashes in red.
If you hold down the shutter button, you can shoot continuously to obtain
different poses and facial expressions. (Up to approx. 3 shots per sec. in
JPEG quality.)
If necessary, the built-in flash will pop up automatically.

58

3 Shooting Landscapes
Use the <3> (Landscape) mode for wide scenery, night scenes, or to
have everything in focus from near to far. The greens and blues also
become more vivid and the image sharper than with <1> (Full Auto).

Shooting Tips

C

Y
P
O

With a zoom lens, use the wide-angle end.
When using the wide-angle end of a zoom lens, objects near and far
will be in focus better than at the telephoto end. It also adds breadth
to landscapes.
Shooting night scenes.
Since the built-in flash will be disabled, this
mode <3> is also good for night scenes.
Use a tripod to prevent camera shake.
If you want to photograph a person against
a night scene, set the Mode Dial to <6>
(Night Portrait) and use a tripod (p.62).

59

4 Shooting Close-ups
When you want to photograph flowers or small things up close, use the
<4> (Close-up) mode. To make small things appear much larger, use a
macro lens (sold separately).

Shooting Tips

C

Y
P
O

Use a simple background.
A simple background makes the flower, etc., stand out better.
Move to the subject as close as possible.
Check the lens for its minimum focusing distance. Some lenses
have indications such as <40.25m/0.8ft>. The lens minimum
focusing distance is measured from the <V> (focal plane) mark on
the top left of the camera to the subject. If you are too close to the
subject, the focus confirmation light <o> will blink.
Under low light, the built-in flash will fire. If you are too close to the
subject and the bottom of the picture looks dark, move away from
the subject.
With a zoom lens, use the telephoto end.
If you have a zoom lens, using the telephoto end will make the
subject look larger.

60

5 Shooting Moving Subjects
To photograph a moving subject, whether it is a child running or a
moving vehicle, use the <5> (Sports) mode.

Shooting Tips

C

Y
P
O

Use a telephoto lens.
Using a telephoto lens is recommended so you can shoot from afar.
Use the center AF point to focus.
Aim the center AF point over the subject, then press the shutter
button halfway to autofocus. During autofocusing, the beeper will
continue beeping softly. If focus cannot be achieved, the focus
confirmation light <o> will blink.
When you want to take the picture, press the shutter button
completely. If you hold down the shutter button, continuous shooting
(max. approx. 3 shots per sec. in JPEG quality) and autofocusing
will take effect.

Under low light when camera shake is prone to occur, the viewfinder’s
shutter speed display on the bottom left will blink. Hold the camera steady
and shoot.

61

6 Shooting Portraits at Night
To shoot someone at night and obtain a natural-looking exposure in the
background, use the <6> (Night Portrait) mode.

Shooting Tips

C

Y
P
O

Use a wide-angle lens and a tripod.
When using a zoom lens, use the wide-angle end to obtain a wide
night view. Also, use a tripod to prevent camera shake.
Keep the person within 5 meters/16.4 feet from the camera.
Under low light, the built-in flash will fire automatically to obtain a
good exposure of the person. The maximum effective distance of the
built-in flash is 5 meters/16.4 feet from the camera.
Shoot also with <1> (Full Auto).
Since camera shake is prone to occur with night shots, shooting also
with <1> (Full Auto) is recommended.

Tell the subject to keep still even after the flash fires.
If you use the self-timer together with flash, the self-timer lamp will light
briefly after the picture is taken.

The number of possible shots displayed is only approximate.
Does the camera display the maximum burst?
The maximum burst is displayed in the viewfinder’s right side. Since
it is only a single-digit indicator 0 - 9, any number higher than 9 will
be displayed only as “9.” Note that this number will also be displayed
even when no card is installed in the camera. Be careful not to shoot

3 Setting the Image-recording Quality

About 1
1 is the raw image data before it is made into 73 or other images.
Although 1 images require software like Digital Photo Professional
(provided, p.270) so they can be displayed on the computer, they also
offer flexibility for image adjustments possible only with 1. 1 is
effective when you want to precisely adjust the image yourself or shoot
an important subject.

About 1+73
1+73 records both a 1 and 73 image with a single shot. The
two images are saved to the card simultaneously. The two images will
be saved in the same folder with the same file numbers (file extension
.JPG for JPEG and .CR2 for RAW). 73 images can be viewed or
printed even with a computer which does not have the software
provided with the camera installed.

One-Shot AF for Still Subjects
Suited for still subjects. When you press the shutter button
halfway, the camera will focus only once.
When focus is achieved, the dot inside the AF point achieving focus
lights briefly in red, and the focus confirmation light <o> in the
viewfinder will also light.
With evaluative metering (p.100), the exposure setting will be set at
the same time focus is achieved.
While you hold down the shutter button halfway, the focus will be
locked. You can then recompose the shot if desired.

81

E: Changing the Autofocus ModeN

If focus cannot be achieved, the focus confirmation light <o> in the
viewfinder will blink. If this occurs, a picture cannot be taken even if the
shutter button is pressed completely. Recompose the picture and try to
focus again. Or see “Subjects Difficult to Focus” (p.85).
If [1 Beep] is set to [Disable], the beeper will not sound when focus is
achieved.

AI Servo AF for Moving Subjects
This AF mode is for moving subjects when the focusing distance
keeps changing. While you hold down the shutter button halfway,
the subject will be focused continuously.
The exposure is set at the moment the picture is taken.
When the AF point selection (p.83) is automatic, the camera first
uses the center AF point to focus. During autofocusing, if the subject
moves away from the center AF point, focus tracking continues as
long as the subject is covered by another AF point.

With AI Servo AF, the beeper will not sound even when focus is achieved.
Also, the focus confirmation light <o> in the viewfinder will not light.

AI Focus AF for Automatic Switching of AF Mode
AI Focus AF switches the AF mode from One-Shot AF to AI Servo
AF automatically if the still subject starts moving.
After the subject is focused in One-Shot AF mode, if the subject
starts moving, the camera will detect the movement and change the
AF mode automatically to AI Servo AF.
When focus is achieved in the AI Focus AF mode with the Servo mode
active, the beeper will sound continuously sofltly. However, the focus
confirmation light <o> in the viewfinder will not light.

Shooting Tips
When shooting a portrait up close, use One-Shot AF and focus
the eyes.
If you focus the eyes first, you can then recompose and the face will
remain sharp.
If it is difficult to focus, select and use the center AF point.
The center AF point is the most sensitive among the nine AF points.
To make it easier to focus a moving subject, set the camera to
automatic AF point selection and AI Servo AF (p.82).
The center AF point will first be used to focus the subject. During
autofocusing, if the subject moves away from the center AF point,
focus tracking continues as long as the subject is covered by
another AF point.

AF-Assist Beam with the Built-in Flash

Under low-light conditions, when you press the shutter button halfway,
the built-in flash fires a brief burst of flashes. It illuminates the subject to
enable easier autofocusing.

C

The AF-assist beam will not be fired in the following shooting modes:
<7>, <3> and <5>.
The AF-assist beam cannot be emitted in the AI Servo AF mode.
The effective range of the AF-assist beam emitted by the built-in flash is
about 4 meters/13.1 feet.
In Creative Zone modes when you raise the built-in flash with the <I>
button (p.88), the AF-assist beam will be fired when necessary.

If you use an Extender (sold separately) and the maximum aperture
becomes smaller than f/5.6, AF shooting will not be possible (except in [Live
mode] and [u Live mode] during Live View shooting). For details, see the
Extender’s instruction manual.

84

Subjects Difficult to Focus
Autofocus can fail to achieve focus (viewfinder’s focus confirmation light
<o> blinks) with certain subjects such as the following:
Very low-contrast subjects.
(Example: Blue sky, solid-color walls, etc.)
Subjects in very low light
Extremely backlit or reflective subjects
(Example: Car with a highly reflective body, etc.)
Near and far subjects covered by an AF point
(Example: Animal in a cage, etc.)
Repetitive patterns
(Example: Skyscraper windows, computer keyboards, etc.)
In such cases, do one of the following:
(1) With One-Shot AF, focus an object at the same distance as the
subject and lock the focus before recomposing (p.52).
(2) Set the lens focus mode switch to <MF> and focus manually.

94

f: Changing the Depth of Field

Shooting Tips
When using an aperture with a high f/number, note that camera
shake can occur in low light scenes.
A higher aperture f/number will make the shutter speed slower.
Under low light, the shutter speed can be as long as 30 sec. In such
cases, increase the ISO speed and hold the camera steady or use a
tripod.
The depth of field depends not only on the aperture, but also on
the lens and on the subject distance.
Since wide-angle lenses have a wide depth of field (range of
acceptable focus in front of and behind the point of focus), you need
not set a high aperture f/number to obtain a sharp picture from the
foreground to the background. On the other hand, a telephoto lens
has a narrow depth of field.
And the closer the subject, the narrower the depth of field. A farther
subject will have a wider depth of field.

About the Lens Correction Data
The camera already contains lens peripheral illumination correction
data for about 25 lenses. In step 2, if you select [Enable], the peripheral
light correction will be applied automatically for any lens whose
correction data has been registered in the camera.
With EOS Utility (provided software, p.270), you can check which
lenses have their correction data registered in the camera. You can also
register the correction data for unregistered lenses. For details, see the
Software Instruction Manual (CD-ROM) for EOS Utility (p.272).

P
O

For JPEG images already captured, lens peripheral illumination
correction cannot be applied.
Depending on shooting conditions, noise might appear on the image
periphery.
When using a non-Canon lens, setting the correction to [Disable] is
recommended, even if [Correction data available] is displayed.
Lens peripheral light correction is also applied when an Extender is
attached.
If the correction data for the attached lens has not been registered to the
camera, the result will be the same as when the correction is set to
[Disable].
The correction amount applied will be slightly lower than the maximum
correction amount settable with Digital Photo Professional (provided
software).
If the lens does not have distance information, the correction amount will
be lower.
The higher the ISO speed, the lower the correction amount will be.

White Balance Auto Bracketing
With just one shot, three images having a different color balance can be
recorded simultaneously. Based on the color temperature of the current white
balance setting, the image will be bracketed with a blue/amber bias or
magenta/green bias. This is called white balance bracketing (WB-BKT). White
balance bracketing is possible up to ±3 levels in single-level increments.

During WB bracketing, the continuous shooting speed will be slower. The
maximum burst for continuous shooting will also be lower and the number of
possible shots will decrease to one-third the normal number.
You can also set white balance correction and AEB (p.103) together with
white balance bracketing. If you set AEB in combination with white balance
bracketing, a total of nine images will be recorded for a single shot.
Since three images are recorded for one shot, the card will take longer to
record the shot.

The image will look very subdued in a sRGB personal computer
environment and with printers not compatible with Design rule for
Camera File System 2.0 (Exif 2.21). Post-processing of the image with
software will therefore be required.

If the image is captured with the color space set to Adobe RGB, the file
name will start with “_MG_” (first character is an underscore).

Live View Shooting Cautions
White <s> and Red <E> Internal Temperature Warning Icons

If the camera’s internal temperature increases due to prolonged Live
View shooting or a high ambient temperature, a white <s> icon will
appear. If you continue shooting while this icon is displayed, the image
quality of still photos may deteriorate. You should stop the Live View
shooting and allow the camera to cool down before shooting again.
If the camera’s internal temperature further increases while the white
<s> icon is displayed, a red <E> icon will start blinking. This blinking
icon is a warning that the Live View shooting will soon be terminated
automatically. If this happens, you will not be able to shoot again until the
camera’s internal temperature decreases. Turn off the power and let the
camera rest for a while.
Shooting with the Live View function at a high temperature for a
prolonged period will cause the <s> and <E> icons to appear earlier.
When not shooting, turn off the camera.
Live View Image Cautions

Y
P
O

Under low- or bright-light conditions, the Live View image might not
reflect the brightness of the captured image.
If the light source within the image changes, the screen might flicker. If
this happens, stop the Live View shooting and resume shooting under
the actual light source to be used.
If you point the camera in a different direction, it might throw off the Live
View image’s correct brightness momentarily. Wait until the brightness
level stabilizes before shooting.
If there is a very bright light source in the picture, such as the sun, the
bright area might appear black on the LCD monitor. However, the actual
captured image will correctly show the bright area.
In low light, if you set the [6 LCD brightness] to a bright setting,
chrominance noise may appear in the Live View image. However, the
chrominance noise will not be recorded in the captured image.
When you magnify the image, the image sharpness may look more
pronounced than it really is.

136

Live View Shooting Cautions
Shooting Result Cautions

When you shoot continuously with the Live View function for a long
period, the camera’s internal temperature may increase and it can
degrade image quality. Terminate Live View shooting when not shooting
images.
Before taking a long exposure, stop Live View shooting temporarily and
wait several minutes before shooting. This is to prevent image
degradation.
Live View shooting in high temperatures and at high ISO speeds may
cause noise or irregular colors.
When you shoot at high ISO speeds, noise (banding, dots of light, etc.)
may become noticeable.
If you take the picture during magnified view, the exposure might not
come out as desired. Return to the normal view before taking the picture.
During the magnified view, the shutter speed and aperture will be
displayed in orange. Even if you take the picture during magnified view,
the image will be captured in the normal view.
If [2 Auto Lighting Optimizer] (p.107) is not set to [Disable], the
image may look bright even if a decreased exposure compensation or
decreased flash exposure compensation has been set.
If you use a TS-E lens to shift the lens vertically or use an Extension
Tube, the standard exposure might not be obtained or an irregular
exposure may result.

C

Y
P
O

Custom Function Cautions

During Live View shooting, certain Custom Function settings will not take
effect (p.217).
Lens and Flash Cautions

The focus preset feature on super telephoto lenses cannot be used.
FE lock is not possible when the built-in flash or an external Speedlite is
used. Modeling flash will not work with an external Speedlite.

About the Red <E> Internal Temperature Warning Icon
If the camera’s internal temperature is high, a blinking red icon <E> may
appear. This blinking icon is a warning that the movie shooting will soon
be terminated automatically. If this happens, you will not be able to shoot
again until the camera’s internal temperature decreases. Turn off the
power and let the camera rest for a while.
Movie shooting at a high temperature for a prolonged period will cause
the <E> icon to appear sooner. When not shooting, turn off the camera.

Movie Shooting Cautions
Recording and Image Quality

If the attached lens has an Image Stabilizer, the Image Stabilizer will
operate at all times even if you do not press the shutter button halfway.
The Image Stabilizer will thereby consume battery power and may
shorten the total movie shooting time or decrease the number of possible
shots. If you use a tripod or if the Image Stabilizer is not necessary, you
should set the IS switch to <2>.
The camera’s built-in microphone will also record camera operation
noise.
If movie shooting is not possible due to insufficient remaining capacity of
the card, the movie recording size and movie shooting remaining time
(p.142) will be displayed in red.
If you use a card having a slow writing speed, a five-level
indicator might appear on the right of the screen during
movie shooting. It indicates how much data has not yet been
written to the card (remaining capacity of the internal buffer
memory). The slower the card, the faster the indicator will
climb upward. If the indicator becomes full, movie shooting
will stop automatically.
Indicator
If the card has a fast writing speed, the indicator will either
not appear or the level (if displayed) will hardly go upward.
First, shoot a few test movies to see if the card can write fast enough.

Movie Shooting Cautions
Playback and TV connection

If the brightness changes during movie shooting, that part might look
momentarily still when you playback the movie.
If you connect the camera to a TV set with an HDMI cable (p.191) and
shoot a movie, the movie being shot will be displayed at a small size on
the TV. But the movie will still be properly recorded in High-Definition
(HD) quality.
If you connect the camera to a TV set and shoot a movie, the TV will not
output any sound during the shooting. However, the sound will be
properly recorded.

About Folders

C

Y
P
O

As with “100CANON” for example, the folder name starts with three digits
(folder number) followed by five alphanumeric characters. A folder can contain
up to 9999 images (file No. 0001 - 9999). When a folder becomes full, a new
folder with a higher one-up folder number is created automatically. Also, if
manual reset (p.159) is executed, a new folder will be created automatically.
Folders numbered from 100 to 999 can be created.

Creating Folders with a Personal Computer
With the card open on the screen, create a new folder named “DCIM”. Open
the DCIM folder and create as many folders as necessary to save and
organize your images. The folder name must follow the “100ABC_D” format
where the first three digits is 100 - 999 followed by five alphanumeric
characters. The five characters can be a combination of upper- or lower-case
letters from A to Z, numerals, and an underscore “_”. There can be no space in
the folder name. Also, folder names cannot have the same three-digit number
such as “100ABC_D” and “100W_XYZ” even if the letters are different.

157

Handy Features

3 File Numbering Methods
The image files will be numbered from 0001 to 9999 in the order the
images are taken, then saved in a folder. You can change how the file
number is assigned.
The file number will appear on your computer in this format:
IMG_0001.JPG.
Under the [5] tab, select [File
numbering], then press <0>. The
available settings are described below.
Select one, then press <0>.

Y

O

[Continuous]: The file numbering continues in sequence even
after you replace the card or create a folder.
Even after you replace the card or create a new folder, the file
numbering continues in sequence up to 9999. This is convenient
when you want to save images numbered anywhere between 0001
to 9999 in multiple cards or folders into one folder in your personal
computer.
If the replacement card or existing folder already contains images
recorded previously, the file numbering of the new images might
continue from the file numbering of the existing images in the card or
folder. If you want to use continuous file numbering, you should use
a newly-formatted card each time.

organize images according to cards or folders.
If the replacement card or existing folder already contains images
recorded previously, the file numbering of the new images might
continue from the file numbering of the existing images in the card or
folder. If you want to save images with the file numbering starting
from 0001, use a newly formatted card each time.

[Manual reset]: To reset the file numbering to 0001 manually or
to start from file number 0001 in a new folder.
When you reset the file numbering manually, a new folder is created
automatically and the file numbering of images saved to that folder
starts from 0001.
This is convenient if you want to use different folders for the images
taken yesterday and the ones taken today, for example.
After the manual reset, the file numbering returns to continuous or
auto reset. (There will be no Manual reset confirmation screen.)
If the file number in folder No. 999 reaches 9999, shooting will not be
possible even if the card still has storage capacity. The LCD monitor will
display a message telling you to replace the card. Replace it with a new
card.
For both JPEG and RAW images, the file name will start with “IMG_”. Movie
file names will start with “MVI_”. The extension will be “.JPG” for JPEG
images, “.CR2” for RAW images, and “. MOV” for movies.

Shutter sync.
Normally, set this to [1st curtain] so that the flash fires immediately
after the exposure starts.
If [2nd curtain] is set, the flash will fire right before the exposure
ends. When this is combined with a slow sync speed, you can create
a trail of light such as from car headlights at night. With 2nd-curtain
sync, a preflash is fired when you press the shutter button
completely. This is to determine the exposure. Then immediately
before the exposure ends, the real flash is fired. Therefore, two
flashes will be fired. However, with shutter speeds faster than 1/30
sec., 1st curtain sync will automatically take effect.
If an external Speedlite is attached, you can also set [Hi-speed]. For
details, see the Speedlite’s instruction manual.

Dust entering the camera can adhere to the image sensor and cause
dust spots to be visible on the captured images. To erase these dust
spots, you can append the Dust Delete Data to the images. The Dust
Delete Data is used by Digital Photo Professional (provided software,
p.270) to erase the dust spots automatically.

Preparation
Get a solid-white object (paper, etc.).
Set the lens focal length to 50mm or longer.

About the Dust Delete Data

After the Dust Delete Data is obtained, it is appended to all the JPEG
and RAW images captured thereafter. Before an important shoot, you
should update the Dust Delete Data by obtaining it again.
For details about using Digital Photo Professional (provided software,
p.270) to erase dust spots, see the Software Instruction Manual (p.272)
in the Software Instruction Manual CD-ROM.
The Dust Delete Data appended to the image is so small that it hardly
affects the image file size.
Be sure to use a solid-white object such as a new sheet of white paper. If the
paper has any pattern or design, it may be recognized as dust data and
affect the accuracy of the dust deletion with the software.

3 Manual Sensor CleaningN
If dust adhere to the image sensor and dust spots appear on the
images, you can clean the image sensor yourself with a camera blower.
The surface of the image sensor is extremely delicate. If the
sensor needs to be cleaned directly, having it done by a Canon
Service Center is recommended.

3 Manual Sensor CleaningN

While cleaning the sensor, never do any of the following. If the
power is cut off, the shutter will close and the shutter curtains and
image sensor might get damaged.
• Setting the power switch to <2>.
• Opening the card/battery compartment cover.
The surface of the image sensor is extremely delicate. Clean the sensor
with care.
Use a plain blower without any brush attached. A brush can scratch the
sensor.
Do not insert the blower tip inside the camera beyond the lens mount. If
the power is turned off, the shutter will close and the shutter curtains or
reflex mirror might get damaged.
Never use canned air or gas to clean the sensor. The blowing force can
damage the sensor or the spray gas can freeze on the sensor.
If the battery level becomes low while you clean the sensor, the beeper
will sound as a warning. Stop cleaning the sensor.
If a smudge that cannot be removed with a blower remains, having the
sensor cleaned by a Canon Service Center is recommended.

k Enjoying Movies
Basically, you can playback movies in the following three ways:

Playback on a TV set

(p.191)

An HDMI cable (sold separately) is
necessary to connect the camera to a
TV set. The TV set must also have an
HDMI terminal.
When the camera is connected to a TV
set with an HDMI cable, you can
playback movies and still photos on the
TV set. If you use a High-Definition TV
set to playback High-Definition (HD)
movies shot with this camera, you can
watch the movies in high definition.

Y
P
O

The camera does not have an audio/video OUT terminal. Therefore, the
camera cannot be connected to a TV set with an analog AV cable.
Movies on a card can be played only by devices compatible with MOV
files.
Since hard disk recorders do not have an HDMI IN terminal, the camera
cannot be connected to a hard disk recorder with an HDMI cable.
Even if the camera is connected to a hard disk recorder with a USB
cable, movies and still photos cannot be played nor saved.

C

Using HDMI Cable HTC-100 (sold separately) is recommended.

184

k Enjoying Movies

Playback on the Camera’s LCD Monitor

(p.186-190)

You can playback movies on the
camera’s LCD monitor. You can also edit
out the movie’s first and last scenes, and
playback the images and movies in the
card in an automatic slide show.

A movie edited with a personal computer cannot be rewritten to the card and
played back with the camera.

Playback and Editing with a Personal Computer

O

(See the PDF file instruction manual for ZoomBrowser EX/ImageBrowser, p.272)

The movie files recorded in the card can
be transferred to a personal computer
and played or edited with ZoomBrowser
EX/ImageBrowser (provided software,
p.270).
You can also extract a single frame from
a movie and save it as a still photo.

C

To have the movie playback smoothly on a personal computer, use a
high-performance personal computer. Regarding the computer hardware
requirements for ZoomBrowser EX/ImageBrowser, see the PDF file
instruction manual.
If you want to use commercially-available software to playback or edit the
movies, be sure it is compatible with MOV files. For details on

The flash sync speed is set automatically within a range of 1/200 sec. to
30 sec. to suit the scene’s brightness. With an external Speedlite, highspeed sync will also be possible.
1: 1/200-1/60 sec. auto
Prevents a slow shutter speed from being set in low-light conditions. It is
effective for preventing subject blur and camera shake. However, while
the subject will be properly exposed with the flash, the background may
come out dark.
2: 1/200 sec. (fixed)
The flash-sync speed is fixed to 1/200 sec. This more effectively
prevents subject blur and camera shake than with setting 1. However,
the background may come out darker than with setting 1.
When 1 or 2 is set, high-speed sync cannot be used with an external
Speedlite.

Long exposure noise reduction

0: Off
1: Auto
For 1 sec. or longer exposures, noise reduction is performed
automatically if noise typical of long exposures is detected. This [Auto]
setting is effective in most cases.
2: On
Noise reduction is performed for all exposures of 1 sec. or longer. The
[On] setting may be effective for noise that cannot be detected or
reduced with the [Auto] setting.
With settings 1 and 2, the continuous shooting speed will be slower even
with shutter speeds faster than 1 sec. (with the image-recording quality
set to JPEG). The maximum burst during continuous shooting will also
decrease (with the image-recording quality set to JPEG). Settings 1 and
2 are recommended only when shooting long exposures.
With settings 1 and 2, after the picture is taken, the noise reduction
process may take the same amount of time as the exposure. You cannot
take another picture until the noise reduction process is completed.
At ISO 1600 and higher, noise might be more pronounced with setting 2
than with setting 0 or 1.
With setting 1 or 2, if a long exposure is shot with the Live View image
displayed, “BUSY” will be displayed during the noise reduction process.
The Live View display will not appear until the noise reduction is
completed. (You cannot take another picture.)

With setting 2, the continuous shooting speed will be slower (with the
image-recording quality set to JPEG or 1+73). The maximum burst
during continuous shooting will also decrease (with the image-recording
quality set to JPEG or 1).
If you playback a 1 or 1+73 image with the camera or print an

AF-assist beam firing

The AF-assist beam can be emitted by the camera’s built-in flash or by an
external, EOS-dedicated Speedlite.
0: Enable

external Speedlite.
1: Disable
The AF-assist beam is not emitted.

220

3 Custom Function SettingsN

2: Enable external flash only
If an external Speedlite is attached, it will emit the AF-assist beam when
necessary. The camera’s built-in flash will not fire the AF-assist beam.
3: IR AF assist beam only
Among external Speedlites, only those which have an infrared AF-assist
beam will be able to emit the beam. This prevents any Speedlite which
uses a series of small flashes (like the built-in flash) from firing the AFassist beam.
With an EX-series Speedlite equipped with a LED light, the LED light will
not automatically turn on for AF-assist.
If the external Speedlite’s [AF-assist beam firing] Custom Function is set

External Speedlites
EOS-dedicated, EX-series Speedlites
Basically operates like a built-in flash for easy operation.
When an EX-series Speedlite (sold separately) is attached to the
camera, almost all the autoflash control is done by the camera. In other
words, it is like a high-output flash attached externally in place of the
built-in flash.
For detailed instructions, see the EX-series Speedlite’s instruction
manual. This camera is a Type-A camera that can use all the features
of EX-series Speedlites.

Set the camera’s shooting mode to <a> (manual exposure) or
<f> (aperture-priority AE) and adjust the aperture setting before
shooting.
If you are using a Speedlite which has manual flash mode, shoot in
the manual flash mode.

Using Non-Canon Flash Units
Sync Speed
The camera can synchronize with compact, non-Canon flash units at

Using the Eyepiece Cover

When you use the self-timer, bulb, or Remote Switch and do not look
through the viewfinder, stray light entering the viewfinder can cause the
image to look dark. To prevent this, use the eyepiece cover (p.25)
attached to the camera strap.
During Live View shooting and movie shooting, attaching the
eyepiece cover is unnecessary.

Using Eye-Fi Cards
With a commercially-available Eye-Fi card already set up, you can
automatically transfer captured images to a personal computer or
upload them to an online service via a wireless LAN.
The image transfer is a function of the Eye-Fi card. For instructions on
how to set up and use the Eye-Fi card or to troubleshoot any image
transfer problems, refer to the Eye-Fi card’s instruction manual or
inquire the card’s manufacturer.
The camera is not guaranteed to support Eye-Fi card functions
(including wireless transfer). In case of an issue with an Eye-Fi
card, please check with the card manufacturer. Also note that
approval is required to use Eye-Fi cards in many countries or
regions. Without approval, use of the card is not permitted. If it
is unclear whether the card has been approved for use in your
area, please check with the card manufacturer.

Cautions for Using Eye-Fi Cards
If “J” is displayed, an error occurred while retrieving the card
information. Turn the camera off and on again.
Even if [Eye-Fi trans.] is set to [Disable], it may still transmit a signal. In
hospitals, airports, and other places where wireless transmissions are
prohibited, remove the Eye-Fi card from the camera.
If the image transfer does not function, check the Eye-Fi card and
personal computer settings. For details, see the card’s instruction
manual.
Depending on the wireless LAN’s connection conditions, the image
transfer may take longer or it might be interrupted.
Because of the transmission function, the Eye-Fi card may become hot.
The battery power will be consumed faster.
During the image transfer, auto power off will not take effect.

Troubleshooting Guide
If a problem occurs with the camera, first refer to this Troubleshooting
Guide. If this Troubleshooting Guide does not resolve the problem,
contact your dealer or nearest Canon Service Center.

Power-Related Problems
The battery pack does not recharge.
Do not recharge any battery pack other than a genuine Canon Battery
Pack LP-E10.

The battery charger’s lamp blinks.
If there is a problem with the battery charger, the protective circuit will stop
the charging operation and the charge lamp will blink in orange. If this
happens, disconnect the charger’s power plug from the power outlet and
remove the battery pack. Attach the battery pack to the charger again and
wait a while before connecting the charger to a power outlet again.

Y
P
O

The camera does not operate even when the power switch is set to <1>.

C

Make sure the card/battery compartment cover is closed (p.28).
The battery is not properly installed in the camera (p.28).
Recharge the battery (p.26).
Press the <B> button (p.46).

The access lamp still blinks even when the power switch is set to <2>.
If the power is turned off while an image is being recorded to the card,
the access lamp will still continue to light/blink for a few seconds.
When the image recording is completed, the power will turn off
automatically.

The battery becomes exhausted quickly.
Use a fully-charged battery pack (p.26).
The rechargeable battery pack performance will degrade over
repeated use. Purchase a new one.

242

Troubleshooting Guide

If you use Live View shooting or shoot movies for a prolonged period
(p.121, 139), the number of possible shots will decrease.
If you hold down the shutter button for a long time or often use only the
AF without taking pictures, the number of possible shots will decrease.
If you often use the LCD monitor, the number of possible shots will
decrease.
If you use the lens Image Stabilizer, the number of possible shots will
decrease.

The camera turns off by itself.
Auto power off is in effect. If you do not want auto power off to take
effect, set [5 Auto power off] to [Off] (p.155).
Even if [5 Auto power off] has been set to [Off], the LCD monitor will
still turn off after the camera is idle for 30 min. Press the <B>
button to turn on the LCD monitor.

Y
P
O

Shooting-Related Problems

C

No images can be shot nor recorded.

The card is not properly inserted (p.28).
If the card is full, replace the card or delete unnecessary images to
make room (p.28, 196).
If you try to focus in the One-Shot AF mode while the focus
confirmation light <o> in the viewfinder blinks, a picture cannot be
taken. Press the shutter button halfway again to focus, or focus
manually (p.39, 85).
Slide the card’s write-protect switch to the Write/Erase setting (p.28).

The card cannot be used.
If a card error message is displayed, see page 30 or 250.

243

Troubleshooting Guide

The file numbering does not start from 0001.
If the card already contains recorded images, the image number might
not start from 0001 (p.158).

The image is out of focus.
Set the lens focus mode switch to <AF> (p.35).
To prevent camera shake, press the shutter button gently (p.38, 39).
If the lens has an Image Stabilizer, set the IS switch to <1>.
In low light, the shutter speed may become slow. Use a faster shutter speed
(p.92), set a higher ISO speed (p.77), use flash (p.88), or use a tripod.

Horizontal stripes appear, or the exposure or color tone look
strange.

Y
P
O

Horizontal stripes or irregular exposures can be caused by fluorescent
light, LED bulbs, or other artificial lighting during viewfinder or Live
View shooting. Also, the exposure or color tone might not come out
right. A slow shutter speed may solve the problem.

C

The continuous shooting speed is slower./
The maximum burst during continuous shooting is lower.
Under [7 Custom Functions (C.Fn)], if [3: Long exposure noise
reduction] is set to [0: Off] and [4: High ISO speed noise reduction]
to any setting other than [2: Strong], the continuous shooting speed
will return to normal. The maximum burst during continuous shooting
will also return to normal.
If you shoot something that has fine detail (field of grass, etc.), the file
size will be larger and the actual maximum burst might be lower than
the number mentioned on page 74.

ISO 100 cannot be set.
Under [7 Custom Functions (C.Fn)], if [5: Highlight tone priority]
is set to [1: Enable], ISO 100 cannot be set. If [0: Disable] is set, ISO
100 can be set (p.220).

244

Troubleshooting Guide

The Auto Lighting Optimizer cannot be set.
Under the [7 Custom Functions (C.Fn)] menu, if [5: Highlight tone
priority] is set to [1: Enable], the Auto Lighting Optimizer cannot be
set. If [0: Disable] is set, the Auto Lighting Optimizer can be set
(p.107).

When I use the <f> mode with flash, the shutter speed becomes slow.
If you shoot at night when the background is dark, the shutter speed
becomes slow automatically (slow-sync shooting) so that both the
subject and background are properly exposed. If you do not want a
slow shutter speed to be set, set [2: Flash sync. speed in Av mode]
in [7 Custom Functions (C.Fn)] to 1 or 2 (p.218).

Y
P
O

The built-in flash pops up by itself.

In the 1, 2, 4, and 6 modes, the built-in flash will pop-up
automatically when flash is necessary.

C

The built-in flash does not fire.

If you shoot continuously with the built-in flash at short intervals, the
flash might stop operating to protect the flash unit.

I cannot set flash exposure compensation with [External
flash func. setting].
If flash exposure compensation has been set on an external Speedlite,
[Flash exp. comp] (p.169) cannot be set in the [External flash func.
setting] screen. Also, if you set flash exposure compensation with the
camera and then set flash exposure compensation with the external
Speedlite, the Speedlite’s flash exposure compensation setting will
override the camera’s. When the Speedlite’s flash exposure
compensation is canceled, flash exposure compensation can be set
with the camera.

245

Troubleshooting Guide

High-speed sync cannot be set in the <f> mode.
Under [7 Custom Functions (C.Fn)], set [2: Flash sync. speed in
Av mode] to [0: Auto] (p.218).

The camera makes a noise when it is shaken.
The built-in flash’s pop-up mechanism moves slightly. This is normal.

The shutter makes two shooting sounds during Live View shooting.
If you use flash, the shutter will make two sounds each time you shoot
(p.123).

During Live View shooting and movie shooting, the E icon appears.

Y
P
O

It indicates that the camera’s internal temperature is high. If the <s>
icon is white, the still photo’s image quality might deteriorate. If the
<E> icon is red, it indicates that the Live View or movie shooting will
soon be terminated automatically (p.136, 150).

C

Movie shooting terminates by itself.

If the card’s writing speed is slow, movie shooting may stop
automatically. Use an SD Speed Class 6 “
” or faster card. To
find out the card’s read/write speed, see the card manufacturer’s Web
site, etc.
If a movie clip’s file size reaches 4 GB or the shooting length reaches
29 min. 59 sec., the movie shooting will stop automatically.

The image flickers or horizontal stripes appear during movie
shooting.
Flickering, horizontal stripes (noise), or irregular exposures can be
caused by fluorescent light, LED bulbs, or other artificial lighting during
movie shooting. Also, changes in the exposure (brightness) or color
tone might also be recorded.

246

Troubleshooting Guide

Playback Problems
The LCD monitor does not display a clear image.
If the LCD monitor is dirty, use a soft cloth to clean it.
In low or high temperatures, the LCD monitor display may seem slow
or might look black. It will return to normal at room temperature.

Part of the image blinks in black.
It is the highlight alert (p.200). Overexposed highlight areas with a loss
of highlight detail will blink.

The image cannot be erased.

Y
P
O

If the image has been protected, it cannot be erased (p.194).

The movie cannot play.

C

Movies edited with a personal computer using the provided
ZoomBrowser EX/ImageBrowser (p.270) or other software cannot be
played with the camera.

When the movie is played, camera operation noise can be heard.
If you operate the camera’s dials or lens during movie shooting, the
operation noise will also be recorded.

The movie has still moments.
If there is a drastic change in the exposure during movie shooting, the
autoexposure stops the recording momentarily until the exposure
stabilizes.

The subject looks distorted during movie shooting.
If you move the camera to the left or right quickly (high-speed panning)
or shoot a moving subject, the image may look distorted.

247

Troubleshooting Guide

I cannot connect the camera to my TV set.
An HDMI cable (sold separately) is necessary to connect the camera
to a TV set. Using the HDMI Cable HTC-100 (sold separately) is
recommended (p.191).
Also check that your TV set has an HDMI IN terminal. If the TV set
does not have an HDMI IN terminal and has only an A/V IN jack, the
camera cannot be connected.

No image appears on the TV screen.
Make sure the HDMI cable’s plug is inserted all the way in (p.191).
Using HDMI Cable HTC-100 (sold separately) is recommended
(p.191).

Y
P
O

My card reader does not recognize the card.
Depending on the card reader and computer OS used, SDXC cards
might not be correctly recognized. In such a case, connect your
camera to the computer with the provided interface cable, then
transfer the images to your computer using EOS Utility (provided
software, p.270).

Safety Warnings
Follow these safeguards and use the equipment properly to prevent injury, death,
and material damage.

Preventing Serious Injury or Death
• To prevent fire, excessive heat, chemical leakage, and explosions, follow the
safeguards below:
- Do not use any batteries, power sources, and accessories not specified in this
booklet. Do not use any home-made or modified batteries.
- Do not short-circuit, disassemble, or modify the battery pack or back-up battery. Do
not apply heat or apply solder to the battery pack or back-up battery. Do not expose
the battery pack or back-up battery to fire or water. And do not subject the battery
pack or back-up battery to strong physical shock.
- Do not install the battery pack or back-up battery in reversed polarity (+ –). Do not
mix new and old or different types of batteries.
- Do not recharge the battery pack outside the allowable ambient temperature range
of 0°C - 40°C (32°F - 104°F). Also, do not exceed the recharging time.
- Do not insert any foreign metallic objects into the electrical contacts of the camera,
accessories, connecting cables, etc.
• Keep the back-up battery away from children. If a child swallows the battery, consult a
physician immediately. (Battery chemicals may harm the stomach and intestines.)
• When disposing of a battery pack or back-up battery, insulate the electrical contacts
with tape to prevent contact with other metallic objects or batteries. This is to prevent
fire or an explosion.
• If excessive heat, smoke, or fumes are emitted during battery pack recharging,
immediately unplug the battery charger from the power outlet to stop the recharging
and prevent a fire.
• If the battery pack or back-up battery leaks, changes color, deforms, or emits smoke or
fumes, remove it immediately. Be careful not to get burned in the process.
• Prevent any battery leakage from contacting your eyes, skin, and clothing. It can
cause blindness or skin problems. If the battery leakage contacts your eyes, skin, or
clothing, flush the affected area with lots of clean water without rubbing it. See a
physician immediately.
• During the recharging, keep the equipment away from the reach of children. The cord
can accidentally choke the child or give an electrical shock.
• Do not leave any cords near a heat source. It can deform the cord or melt the
insulation and cause a fire or electrical shock.
• Do not fire the flash at someone driving a car. It may cause an accident.
• Do not fire the flash near a person’s eyes. It may impair the person’s vision. When
using flash to photograph an infant, keep at least 1 meter away.
• Before storing the camera or accessory when not in use, remove the battery pack and
disconnect the power plug. This is to prevent electrical shock, heat generation, and
fire.
• Do not use the equipment where there is flammable gas. This is to prevent an
explosion or fire.

C

Y
P
O

259

• If you drop the equipment and the casing breaks open to expose the internal parts, do
not touch the internal parts due to the possibility of electrical shock.
• Do not disassemble or modify the equipment. High-voltage internal parts can cause
electrical shock.
• Do not look at the sun or an extremely bright light source through the camera or lens.
Doing so may damage your vision.
• Keep the camera from the reach of small children. The neck strap can accidentally
choke the child.
• Do not store the equipment in dusty or humid places. This is to prevent fire and
electrical shock.
• Before using the camera inside an airplane or hospital, check if it is allowed.
Electromagnetic waves emitted by the camera may interfere with the plane’s
instruments or the hospital’s medical equipment.
• To prevent fire and electrical shock, follow the safeguards below:
- Always insert the power plug all the way in.
- Do not handle a power plug with wet hands.
- When unplugging a power plug, grasp and pull the plug instead of the cord.
- Do not scratch, cut, or excessively bend the cord or put a heavy object on the cord.
Also do not twist or tie the cords.
- Do not connect too many power plugs to the same power outlet.
- Do not use a cord whose insulation has been damaged.
• Occasionally unplug the power plug and use a dry cloth to clean off the dust around
the power outlet. If the surrounding is dusty, humid, or oily, the dust on the power outlet
may become moist and short-circuit the outlet to cause a fire.

Preventing Injury or Equipment Damage

• Do not leave equipment inside a car under the hot sun or near a heat source. The
equipment may become hot and cause skin burns.
• Do not carry the camera around while it is attached to a tripod. Doing so may cause
injury. Also make sure the tripod is sturdy enough to support the camera and lens.
• Do not leave a lens or lens-attached camera under the sun without the lens cap
attached. Otherwise, the lens may concentrate the sun’s rays and cause a fire.
• Do not cover or wrap the battery-recharging apparatus with a cloth. Doing so may trap
heat within and cause the casing to deform or catch fire.
• If you drop the camera in water or if water or metal fragments enter inside the camera,
promptly remove the battery pack and back-up battery. This is to prevent fire and
electrical shock.
• Do not use or leave the battery pack or back-up battery in a hot environment. Doing so
may cause battery leakage or a shorter battery life. The battery pack or back-up
battery can also become hot and cause skin burns.
• Do not use paint thinner, benzene, or other organic solvents to clean the equipment.
Doing so may cause fire or a health hazard.

If the product does not work properly or requires repair, contact
your dealer or your nearest Canon Service Center.
