when the room is well lit or when you are close to the subject When you press the shutter button halfway the scale display on the bottom of the viewfinder will shrink and turn off For best results take the picture after this scale display turns off The effectiveness of reduction varies depending on the subject Advanced Shooting This chapter builds on Chapter and introduces more ways to shoot creatively The first half of this chapter explains how to use the modes on the Mode Dial All the functions explained in Chapter can also be used in the and modes To see which functions can be used in each shooting mode see page The mark shown on the right of the page title indicates that the function is available only in Creative Zone modes  About the Main Dial Pointer The pointer icon displayed together with the shutter speed aperture setting or exposure compensation amount indicates that you can turn the dial to adjust the respective setting Action Shots You can either freeze the action or create motion blur with the AE mode on the Mode Dial stands for Time value Blurred motion Slow shutter speed sec Frozen action Fast shutter speed sec Set the Mode Dial to the desired shutter speed SetSee Shooting Tips for advice on setting the shutter speed Turning the dial to the right sets faster shutter speed and turning it to the left sets slower one the picture TakeWhen you focus and press the shutter button completely the picture will be taken at the selected shutter speed Shutter Speed Display The LCD monitor displays the shutter speed as fraction However the viewfinder displays only the denominator Also indicates sec and is sec Action Shots Shooting Tips To freeze the action or moving subject Use fast shutter speed such as sec to sec To blur running child or animal giving the impression of fast movement Use medium shutter speed such as sec to sec Follow the moving subject through the viewfinder and press the shutter button to take the picture If you use telephoto lens hold it steady to prevent camera shake How to blur flowing river or water fountain Use slow shutter speed of sec or slower Use tripod to prevent camera shake Set the shutter speed so that the aperture display does not blink in the viewfinder If you press the shutter button halfway and change the shutter speed while the aperture is displayed the aperture display will also change to maintain the same exposure amount of light reaching the image sensor If you exceed the adjustable aperture range the aperture display will blink to indicate that the standard exposure can not be obtained If the exposure will be too dark the maximum aperture smallest number will blink If this happens turn the dial to the left to set slower shutter speed or increase the ISO speed If the exposure will be too bright the minimum aperture highest number will blink If this happens turn the dial to the right to set faster shutter speed or decrease the ISO speed Using the Flash To obtain correct flash exposure the flash output will be set automatically autoflash exposure to match the aperture The flash sync speed can be set from sec to sec Changing the Depth of Field To blur the background or to make everything near and far look sharp set the Mode Dial to AE to adjust the depth of field range of acceptable focus stands for Aperture value which is the size of the diaphragm hole inside the lens Blurred background With low aperture Sharp foreground and background With high aperture Set the Mode Dial to desired aperture SetThethehigher the the wider the depth of field where sharper focus is obtained in both the foreground and background Turning the dial to the right will set higher smaller aperture opening and turning it to the left will set lower larger aperture opening the picture TakeFocus and press the shutter button completely The picture will be taken with the selected aperture Aperture Display The higher the the smaller the aperture opening will be The apertures displayed will differ depending on the lens If no lens is attached to the camera will be displayed for the aperture Changing the Depth of Field Shooting Tips When using an aperture with high note that camera shake can occur in low light scenes higher aperture will make the shutter speed slower Under low light the shutter speed can be as long as sec In such cases increase the ISO speed and hold the camera steady or use tripod The depth of field depends not only on the aperture but also on the lens and on the subject distance Since lenses have wide depth of field range of acceptable focus in front of and behind the point of focus you need not set high aperture to obtain sharp picture from the foreground to the background On the other hand telephoto lens has narrow depth of field And the closer the subject the narrower the depth of field farther subject will have wider depth of field Set the aperture so that the shutter speed display does not blink If you press the shutter button halfway and change the aperture while the shutter speed is displayed the shutter speed display will also change to maintain the same exposure amount of light reaching the image sensor If you exceed the adjustable shutter speed range the shutter speed display will blink to indicate that the standard exposure can not be obtained If the picture will be too dark the sec shutter speed display will blink If this happens turn the dial to the left to set lower aperture or increase the ISO speed If the picture will be too bright the sec shutter speed display will blink If this happens turn the dial to the right to set higher aperture or decrease the ISO speed Changing the Depth of Field Using the Flash To obtain correct flash exposure the flash output will be set automatically to match the set aperture autoflash exposure The shutter speed will be set automatically between sec sec to suit the scene brightness In low light the main subject is exposed with the automatic flash and the background is exposed with slow shutter speed set automatically Both the subject and background look properly exposed automatic flash sync If you are handholding the camera keep it steady to prevent camera shake Using tripod is recommended If you do not want slow shutter speed to be used set Flash sync speed in Av mode to sec auto or sec fixed in Custom Functions Depth of Field PreviewN The aperture opening diaphragm changes only at the moment when the picture is taken Otherwise the aperture remains fully open Therefore when you look at the scene through the viewfinder or LCD monitor the depth of field will look narrow With the procedure below you can check the depth of field before taking the picture Enable preview to be used Under Custom Functions set Assign SET button to preview For details about Custom Function settings see page Exit the menu Press the button two times to exit the menu Press The aperture will be stopped down so you can see the depth of field While looking at the Live View image and holding down the button you can change the aperture and see how the depth of field changes Manual Exposure You can set both the shutter speed and aperture manually as desired While referring to the exposure level indicator in the viewfinder you can set the exposure as desired This method is called manual exposure stands for Manual Set the Mode Dial to the shutter speed and aperture To set

set from sec to sec and bulb BULB Bulb Exposures bulb exposure keeps the shutter open for as long as you hold down the shutter button It can be used to photograph fireworks etc In step on the preceding page turn the dial to the left to set BULB The elapsed exposure time will be displayed on the LCD monitor Elapsed exposure time During bulb exposures do not point the lens toward the sun The sun heat can damage the camera internal components Since bulb exposures produce more noise than usual the image might look little grainy You can reduce the noise due to long exposures by setting Long exp noise reduction to Auto or On in the Custom Functions  For bulb exposures using tripod and Remote Switch sold separately is recommended Automatic AE Objects in the foreground and background will be in focus automatically All the AF points will function to detect the subject and the aperture required to attain the necessary depth of field will be set automatically stands for of field This mode sets the depth of field automatically Set the Mode Dial to the subject Focus Aim the AF points over the subjects and press the shutter button halfway All the subjects covered by the AF points flashing in red will be in focus If focus is not achieved the picture can not be taken Take the picture The aperture display in the viewfinder blinks The exposure is correct but the desired depth of field can not be obtained Either use lens or move farther away from the subjects The shutter speed display in the viewfinder blinks If the shutter speed blinks it means that the subject is too dark Increase the ISO speed If the shutter speed blinks it means that the subject is too bright Decrease the ISO speed slow shutter speed has been set Use tripod to steady the camera want to use flash Flash can be used however the result will be the same as using the mode with flash The desired depth of field will not be obtained Changing the Metering ModeN Three methods metering modes to measure the subject brightness are provided Normally evaluative metering is recommended In Basic Zone modes evaluative metering is set automatically Select Metering mode Under the tab select Metering mode then press the
